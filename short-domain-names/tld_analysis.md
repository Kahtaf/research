## Why Are We Only Seeing .me, .bz, and .ws?

1. **Inventory Limitations**: The micro.domains registry likely has limited inventory for 5-letter domains across most TLDs
2. **Pricing Strategy**: Popular TLDs (.com, .net, .io, etc.) may have much higher minimums than what we're searching for
3. **Domain Length**: 5-letter domains are relatively short and more valuable - most popular TLDs may not have budget options
4. **.me Specialization**: The .me TLD registry appears to focus on short, affordable domains - hence the excellent pricing at $2.28

## Recommendations

### Best Deals
1. **✓ .me domains** ($2.28 initial, $19.98/yr renewal)
   - **WINNER for this budget**
   - Perfectly suitable for personal brands, startups, projects
   - Great visual appeal with short, memorable names

2. **~ .bz domains** ($21.98 each)
   - Slightly over the $20/yr renewal budget requirement
   - Good for businesses (Belize = Business Zone)
   - If renewal budget can be stretched to $22, these are viable

### Not Recommended
3. **✗ .ws domains** ($552.50)
   - Far too expensive for this budget
   - Only viable if budget is significantly higher

## Conclusion

**The original .me TLD search was the optimal choice.** The micro.domains catalog appears to specialize in affordable .me domains. The lack of availability in mainstream TLDs (.com, .io, .co, .net, .org, etc.) suggests these are either:
- Held at much higher price points elsewhere
- Not available in bulk at budget retailers
- Reserved for premium registrations only

**For the stated budget of <$20 (initial + renewal), the .me TLD is the only viable mainstream option with sufficient selection.**
