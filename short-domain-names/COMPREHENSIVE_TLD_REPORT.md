### Tested But No Inventory

The following 109 TLDs were systematically tested with zero 5-letter domains found:

**Popular TLDs (0 inventory)**:
- .com, .net, .org - Most popular, none available at budget prices
- .io, .co - Tech favorites, no budget inventory
- .app, .dev, .tech - Modern extensions, no results

**Country TLDs (0 inventory)**:
- .ca, .uk, .de, .fr, .au, .nz - First-world countries, none available
- Other tested: .ch, .es, .is, .nl, .be, etc.

**Creative TLDs (0 inventory)**:
- .tv, .to, .la, .do, .cx, .cc - Fun extensions, no inventory
- .art, .bar, .bio, .cab, .cam, etc. - Keyword domains, none found

**Niche TLDs (0 inventory)**:
- .ai, .ac, .sh, .ph, .in, .id - All tested, none returned results

## Why Only These Three?

1. **Inventory Model**: micro.domains appears to specialize in aggregate/bulk domain listings. They likely only stock inventory they've negotiated volume pricing for.

2. **Short Domain Rarity**: 5-letter domains are valuable and scarce. Most registries either:
   - Don't stock them at budget prices
   - Price them as premium domains
   - Use them for premium/reserved lists

3. **.me Specialization**: The .me TLD registry appears to actively sell short domains at competitive prices. This is likely their primary business model.

4. **Bulk Availability**: The fact that micro.domains has 1,000+ .me domains but only 400 of .bz and .ws suggests .me has established relationship/inventory with the registry operator.

## Analysis: Why Not Other Popular TLDs?

### .com (Not Available)
- **Expected reason**: .com has enormous demand and registrars typically reserve short domains for premium pricing
- **Alternative**: Would cost 5-10x more if available
- **Lesson**: Bulk domain retailers like micro.domains can't compete on .com short domains

### .io (Not Available)
- **Expected reason**: Tech startup premium; short .io domains are in high demand
- **Market**: Typically sold at 10-50x standard pricing
- **Reality**: Not a budget option for anyone

### .co (Not Available)
- **Expected reason**: Popular alternative to .com, limited inventory
- **Availability**: Likely reserved for premium sales

### Country Codes (.ca, .uk, .de, etc.)
- **Expected reason**: Country-specific registries set their own policies
- **Typical model**: Country codes often require residency or have restricted inventory
- **Short domain policy**: Most countries price 5-letter domains at premium rates

## Conclusion

**The original .me TLD research was optimal.**

For the stated budget of **<$20 initial purchase + <$20 renewal**:
- **.me is the only TLD with abundant inventory** (1,000+ options)
- **No mainstream alternatives exist** at this price point
- **.bz could work** if budget stretches to $22/year renewal
- **.ws is only for premium budgets** (10x+ higher cost)

The 125 interesting visual domains found in the .me TLD represent **genuinely exceptional value** - short, memorable domain names at approximately 1/10th the cost of comparable .com or .io domains.

## Recommendation for Future Searchers

If looking for short 5-letter domains on a budget:
1. **First choice**: .me (cheapest, most inventory)
2. **Second choice**: .bz (only if budget flexible, good for "Business")
3. **Alternative strategy**: Look for 4-letter or 6-letter domains in .com/.io/.co (likely cheaper than 5-letter)
4. **Not recommended**: Expect to pay 10-100x more for .com/.io short domains through premium registrars

## Data Summary

- **Total TLDs tested**: 112 (40 two-letter + 72 three-letter)
- **TLDs with 5-letter inventory**: 3
- **Total 5-letter domains available**: 1,800+ (across all TLDs)
- **Under-$20-renewal domains**: ~1,400 (all .me)
- **Within-$20-renewal domains**: ~1,800 (including .bz at $21.98)
