Repositioning [Untimely](https://untimely.app) as a dedicated "Random Scheduling as a Service" API addresses a significant technical gap in a market currently dominated by strictly deterministic cron tools. The service automates the complex logic required for unpredictable timing—such as IANA timezone math, spread distribution, and audit trails—making it a specialized utility for chaos engineering, gamification, and team engagement. Its AI-native architecture leverages the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) and [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org) conventions to ensure seamless discovery and integration by autonomous AI agents. This strategic shift transforms the platform into a foundational infrastructure layer for developers who require stochastic triggers without the fragility of DIY solutions.

**Key Findings**
* **Unfilled Market Gap:** Competitors like cron-job.org or Google Cloud Scheduler are exclusively deterministic; no existing SaaS offers native stochastic timing.
* **Chaos Engineering Fit:** The strongest technical use case is automated fault injection where unpredictability is a core requirement rather than a feature.
* **AI-First Design:** By serving structured metadata and MCP tools, Untimely positions itself as the default scheduling choice for agent-driven development.
* **Webhook-First Pipeline:** The pivot focuses on a robust webhook delivery engine featuring HMAC-SHA256 signing and exponential backoff retries.
